# Hi there! üëã I'm a developer passionate about building robust and efficient systems.

<br>

I've journeyed from fundamental programming concepts to implementing complex projects, and my portfolio showcases a deep interest in **how technologies work "under the hood"**. I am drawn to challenges that require systems thinking, attention to detail, and optimization.

---

### üî≠ My Core Areas and Interests:

*   üî≤ **Deep System Programming with C++:** Creating custom data structures (from lists to dynamic arrays), implementing cryptographic algorithms (MD5, SHA-256) from scratch, and developing multithreaded applications. I love C++ for its power and control over resources.

*   üõ°Ô∏è **Cybersecurity and Network Tools:** Practical development in Python using Scapy and Sockets. I have created a suite of utilities for network scanning (ARP, TCP SYN), web technology analysis, and automating reconnaissance tasks.

*   üåê **Full-Stack Development:** Building complete systems, from backend to frontend. I have experience creating server-side logic with **PHP and MySQL** for user authentication, as well as developing interactive web interfaces with pure **JavaScript**, HTML, and CSS, including Single-Page Application (SPA) architecture.

*   ‚öôÔ∏è **Data Analysis and Processing:** Designing and implementing complex systems for data analysis, such as parsing server log files with regular expressions or a large-scale system for retail trade analysis.
